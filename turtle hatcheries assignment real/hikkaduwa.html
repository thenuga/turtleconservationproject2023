                    <p>About 2 km north of Hikkaduwa, on the beach, is a place called Turtle Hatchery. 
                        The hatchery <br>is a tiny, private research facility that works to preserve marine 
                        turtle species that are in danger <br>of extinction.  It provides a selected exhibition 
                        of   turtle eggs and shows how turtles mature over <br> time. There are some locations where,
                         for an additional cost, you can also get the chance to <br>release newborn turtles into the 
                         huge ocean. The months of March through April are the finest <br> for visiting and viewing the turtles.</p>

                           <p>In this location, you may observe the young turtles at play in a safe environment. If you're lucky, 
                            you might be able to see a baby turtle hatch while observing the eggs and their various patterns. If 
                            there are any baby turtles that are old enough to be released into the ocean, this is your finest chance
                             in life to help the environment by returning a turtle to its natural habitat.</p>

                                With over 8 flights from Chennai, 4 flights from Delhi, 4 flights from Mumbai, 3 flights from Bangalore, <br>
                                 and 2 flights from Madurai, there are 21 non-stop flights from India to Colombo in the price range of <br>

                                The nearest airport to Hikkaduwa is Koggala Airport which is about 29 km away. However, <br>there are better options to 
                                 reach Hikkaduwa. A comfortable but expensive option being, by taking a taxi from <br>the Bandaranaike International Airport
                                  which would take about 1½ hours approx.
