                    Sea turtle conservation throughout Sri Lanka

                Sea turtles in Sri Lanka are regarded as a national asset. The southern beaches of the island are frequently 
                visited by the five species of sea turtles found in Sri Lankan waters: the Green, Leatherback, Olive Ridley, 
                Loggerhead, and Hawksbill. Although sea turtles spend the majority of their lives in the water, they periodically come ashore to deposit their eggs. From Mount Lavinia, along the west coast, south coast, and up to Arugam Bay on the east coast of Sri Lanka, their regional nesting sites range.</p1>                    
                <br>
                <br>
                Sea turtles are globally threatened, many species are now facing extinction. Though the turtles’ natural habitat spans all three temperate oceans, the animals’ populations have collapsed in recent years due to numerous factors. Natural causes are not thought to be contributing to their drop in numbers; large turtles have very few predators, and only sharks, large fish, crocodiles, killer whales, and sometimes octopi will attack an adult. Many species of fish and crabs, however, prey upon young turtles.</p1>

                <br>
                The key players in the decline of the sea turtle population are, as usual when discussing animal population destructions, human beings. Many people throughout the world hunt adult turtles for their meat and fat. Nesting green turtle females, which are the most common species in Sri Lanka, are often killed for their meat, which is considered a delicacy throughout swaths of Asia. Turtle soup continues to be all too common across the continent.Un-hatched turtle eggs are widely considered tasty treats and, to some populations, aphrodisiacs. People take hundreds of thousands of eggs are from local beaches each year.

                   watching is an amazing experience beyond explanation. Watching these calm and<br>  peaceful critters in
                   the sea, slowly swimming, looking for their next meal, or hauling<br>  themselves up to a sandy beach for 
                    nesting - is something that is bound to be in your <br> memory for a long time.
